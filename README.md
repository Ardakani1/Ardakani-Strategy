# Ardakani-Strategy
This repository contains the "Ardakani Dual Condition Strategy," a trading strategy implemented in Pine Script for use on TradingView. The strategy utilizes two base lines derived from Donchian channels and the Average True Range (ATR) indicator to identify potential entry and exit points for long and short trades.

Key features include:

Calculation of two base lines with different lengths to capture market trends.
Entry signals for long and short positions based on price crossovers with the base lines.
Visual markers on the chart to indicate buy and sell signals.
Display of the ATR value and the slope of the shorter base line for additional market analysis.
This strategy is designed to assist traders in making informed decisions based on technical analysis.
